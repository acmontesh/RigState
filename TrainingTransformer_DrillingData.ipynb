    "The objective of this notebook is to train time-series classifiers based on deep learning for rig/well activity identification. The models implemented here are of two types: An LSTM recurrent neural network and a transformer for time series classification. Both models are constructed using the PyTorch library and leverage GPU hardware for faster, more efficient training. "
